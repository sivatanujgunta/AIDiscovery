# 🧠 AI Tool Discovery Platform: Pitch Document

---

## 🚀 Vision

To build the most user-centric AI tool discovery platform that helps end-users effortlessly find, evaluate, and integrate the right AI solutions for their problems. The platform will be powered entirely by AI on the backend for smart curation, personalization, and dynamic maintenance.

---

## ✨ The Problem

Current AI tool directories suffer from a range of issues:

1. **Overwhelming Volume** – Thousands of tools, no differentiation, and poor UX.
2. **Outdated Listings** – Many tools are abandoned or no longer relevant.
3. **Lack of Contextual Discovery** – Tools are listed by category, not by what users are trying to solve.
4. **Zero Stackability Guidance** – Users don’t know how tools work together.
5. **No Personalization** – Users get the same results, regardless of background or intent.
6. **Keyword-Based Search** – Lacks semantic search for better matching.
7. **Limited Pricing Info** – Freemium vs paid vs OSS often unclear.
8. **No Workflow Mapping** – No guidance on how tools fit into actual workflows.
9. **No Verification or Benchmarking** – Hard to know if a tool is trustworthy or effective.
10. **Poor Role-Based UX** – Tools aren’t filtered for roles like PM, dev, indie maker, HR, etc.
